# Sitcom-Generator

i made this in the initial days of my javascript journey
i have this habbit of rewatching sitcoms everyday while having breakfast, i always used to get confused which sitcom should i watch today as i have wathced many, so i made this sitcom genetor which randomly gives a sitcom 
i have used Math.random method to generate a number from 1 to 10 then i linked the sitcom names through switch case using a varible "watch" and then simply used textContent to show the string for which i used template literal
